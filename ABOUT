Welcome to PHP Job Seeker 2

PJS2 is a job search tracking tool that helps candidates track their searches,
companies, specific jobs and contacts in order to help them stay on-track while
seeking a position. While this tool doesn't do the work of searching for jobs,
it makes keeping track of opportunities candidates have found much easier.

At this time, we assume that users are able to install a SSL-enabled web server
with PHP, can use git to download updates, and can set up their own local
installation of MySQL.

Eventually, PJS may evolve into a multi-user resource that will allow others
to host PJS for you but that's not the case today.
