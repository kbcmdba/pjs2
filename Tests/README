Please note: These tests are not intended for the general public. If you intend
to run these tests, you'll need to have Selenium Server set up and running
along with the appropriate modules.

As of this writing, I use a VM running Fedora 25 on my development box to run
tests and write my code. Why a VM? It's a lot harder to break into a VM inside
another machine from the outside when that VM is not exposed to the world.
It's also really easy to take a snapshot of the VM, try new things and then
revert if needed.

For security reasons, I use sudo for everything that requires root-level
access. I hope you do the same to reduce vulnerability.
